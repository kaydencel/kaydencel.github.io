    <h2>Makeup</h2>
    <p> I originally got into makeup by watching makeup tutorials on YouTube during the golden age of beauty gurus in elementary and middle school. 
        I have been able to channel this passion during my time at Northeastern by being a makeup artist for the Avenue Magazine and the Fashion Society: 
        Fashion Society. For the Fashion Show last year, I created about 10 different makeup looks across 4 different themes. On show day, it was very hectic 
        as I had to do some quick changes in between themes and intermissions. This semester at the Avenue magazine, I had the opportunity to do makeup for the 
        Perfume Pheromones, Ethicality of Fur, and Off the Grid articles. I am also doing makeup for the cover page, which is very exciting but also a little intimidating. 
        One of my favorite makeup looks I did on myself was a skull makeup for Halloween. On one half of my face, I left the face makeup natural and did a glittery purple 
        eye look. On the other half of my face, I drew an intricate skull and put some gemstones on. In the future, I hope to experiment more with makeup looks and 
        challenge myself to be more creative and innovative.
