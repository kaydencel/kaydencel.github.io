    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p> My name is Kaydence Lin and I am a third-year studying Data Science and Business Administration with a concentration in Brand Management. 
        I am from Houston, Texas, where I was born and raised. I spent my first semester studying abroad in Berlin, Germany through the N.U. In Program. 
        I did my first co-op at CohnReznick, which is an accounting firm, working in the Digital practice within the Global Consulting Solutions practice. 
        I rotated through two different teams during my time there, including Strategy and Operations and Enterprise Applications - NetSuite software. 
        On campus, I am on the makeup and accessories team of the Avenue, Northeasternâ€™s fashion magazine. Last year, the Avenue launched its Spring 2024 issue: 
        Play. I had the opportunity to source and style accessories for an article called To Glorify and Mortify, which is about the relationship between an 
        artist and their muse, and do makeup for an article called The Fine Line: Art and Austerity, which is about the struggles of being a ballerina. 
        This semester, I had the opportunity to do makeup for three articles and the cover for its Spring 2025 issue: Please. I am also a Data Analyst at Generate 
        on the Internal Insights team. In my free time, I love to listen to music, watch TV, and do nail art.
